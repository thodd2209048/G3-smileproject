Hello our evaluator,

In addition to the source code and report.doc file, we would like to provide you with some additional
information. This file will not explain every line of code we have created for this project. 
However, we hope it will help you to review this project more quickly.

1. Please use the "Open with Live Server" feature in VScode to access our project.
Most of the HTML pages in this project have a header and footer section. 
However, if you directly click on index.html, these sections will not be displayed. 

2. To access the sign in page, you will need to click on the avatar image in the top right corner of the screen. 
Then click on "Log out". After that, click on "Sign in" to navigate to the sign in page.

3. Currently, we have used AngularJS to validate the information that users enter into the input fields on the sign in page. 
However, you cannot log in to your account from this page yet. To navigate to other parts of the project, please return to the homepage.

4.We would like to further explain our use of localstorage. 
In the research section of the homepage, we have displayed several tags related to various topics. 
When the user clicks on these tags, information about the selected tag is saved to localstorage. 
At the same time, the user is redirected to the research page. 
Here, the information from localstorage is retrieved and used to filter and display the correct topic that the user has chosen.

We appreciate your time and effort in evaluating our project.
Thank you!
