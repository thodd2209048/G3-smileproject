        <p>Regular visits to a dentist are part of having good oral health and will aid your overall health. But a post
          on the social media sharing site TikTok has some people wondering about their safety during that dental visit.
          TikTok is full of cautionary tales, most have little or no scientific evidence to support their cautions—like
          the woman who claimed that pregnancy made her teeth decay and break off. There's also a post about avoiding
          caffeine and vitamin C before a dental procedure to avoid facial paralysis. We wanted to see if that was legit
          advice.</p>

        <h3 class="article-section__title">The Story of Bethy.Bee</h3>
        <p>One woman, known as @3ethy or Bethy.Bee, recently shared her story of dental work gone wrong after she ended
          up with half of her face "nearly paralyzed" from too much local anesthesia. "A little word to the wise: Don't
          take any vitamin C or drink any caffeine before your dentist appointment," she said. "They may have a hard
          time numbing you and you'll end up with half your face nearly paralyzed and still no work done 'cause you
          could still feel it."</p>
        <p>In the video, which has been viewed more than 5.2 million times and has received 1.8 million likes, Bethy.Bee
          said that she couldn't even blink her eye after the mishap. "I have to manually shut it. Craziest thing ever,"
          she said, adding that she'd have to visit the dentist again in three weeks for another attempt at the
          procedure.</p>
        <p>Luckily, Bethy.Bee was fine by the next day and shared an update with her TikTok viewers, saying she had
          "full facial movement and automatic blinkers" by then. She also shared with viewers that she is "notoriously
          hard to anesthetize" and that "caffeine and vitamin C can react negatively with anesthesia."</p>

        <h3 class="article-section__title">No Evidence To Avoid Vitamin C Before Dental Work</h3>

        <p>If vitamin C is taken before local anesthesia is administered it may decrease effectiveness, but there's
          little scientific data to back this up, John Luther, DDS, Chief Dental Officer at Western Dental &
          Orthodontics, tells Health.</p>
        <p>"I don't believe there is any credible evidence for this," agrees Charles D. Azzaretti, DDS, Program Director
          of Dental Anesthesiology at NYU Langone Dental Medicine. "I was not able to find anything in the scientific
          literature that supports the theory."</p>
        <p>Dr. Azzaretti tells Health that some dental practice websites offer an explanation for the interference of
          vitamin C in the action of local anesthesia in the dental setting. They claim that lowering the pH interferes
          with the onset of a local anesthetic and since vitamin C (ascorbic acid) is acidic, it could interfere with
          the onset of a local anesthetic.</p>
        <p>But Dr. Azzaretti describes this as a "false inference," since even very large doses of vitamin C after
          ingestion would be diluted, buffered, and excreted. "It would have no appreciable effect on the pH of the
          tissues associated with the dental alveolar structures (tooth sockets)," Dr. Azzaretti explains.</p>
        <p>If taken after surgical procedures, vitamin C has many great qualities including reducing healing time, Dr.
          Luther adds.</p>

        <h3 class="article-section__title">Should I Avoid Caffeine?</h3>

        <p>Again, it's difficult to establish a direct effect between caffeine and the administration of local
          anesthesia, but Dr. Luther says many dentists feel that caffeine decreases the effectiveness of local
          anesthesia administered for dental procedures.</p>
        <p>"Caffeine is known to heighten awareness and in high doses may increase a patient's anxiety or make them
          nervous during dental treatment, affecting the patient's experience whether or not anesthesia is given," he
          explains.</p>
        <p>Dr. Luther says that taking a dietary supplement thought to have a calming effect, such as St. John's Wort,
          might strengthen the overall effect of local anesthetic and improve the patient experience.</p>

        <h3 class="article-section__title">What Affects Local Anesthesia</h3>

        <p>Potentially many things can affect how you react to local anesthesia says Dr. Azzaretti.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>The presence or absence of infection</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>If you have inflammation</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Your level of pain threshold—which can vary greatly between patients</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Patient anxiety associated with oral injections—and with dental treatment in general</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Different injection approaches—such as blocks or infiltration</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>The ability of the patient to metabolize the local anesthetic</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Occasionally, local anesthesia may be injected in a spot that does not completely numb or blocks a nerve in
          the lower jaw, which leads to decreased effectiveness, Dr. Luther says.</p>
        <p>"Personally, I think operator accuracy, thoroughness, and patience is the most important variable," Dr.
          Azzaretti says. "But I believe any of the above variables alone would be at least as significant—and probably
          more—in achieving effective local anesthesia than if the patient had several cups of coffee prior to the
          procedure."</p>
        <p>The bottom line: If you have a cup of coffee or a glass of orange juice before your next cleaning, you should
          be totally fine. But if you're extra anxious, go ahead and skip the drinks if you want.</p>
